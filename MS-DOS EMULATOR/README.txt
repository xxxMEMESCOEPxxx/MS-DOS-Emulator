---DISCLAIMER------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By downloading this program, you agree to these terms:
This program was made by Andrew Maney (C)2020
This program is freeware, and should NOT be sold!
If you payed money for this software, you should demand your money back immediately. Please report people who sold this software to andrewmaney05@gmail.com.
I shall NOT be held RESPONSIBLE for ANY DAMAGE that could occur!


---HOW TO GET STARTED----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the program called "MS_DOS.exe"
If the cmd window is black for a little bit, don't worry. This is just the program loading some scripts.
When a prompt shows up asking you if you want to boot into debug mode, type "N", otherwise the Emulator will crash.
You should now be in the DOS Prompt!
(OPTIONAL) Type "help" for a list of commands and extra information.

---HOW TO ENTER DEBUG MODE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start the Emulator.
Type "restartdb" in the Prompt window. A message will appear asking you if you really want to restart. Type "Y".
Another message will appear asking you if you would like to boot in debug mode. Type "Y" again.
You should be in debug mode!

---HOW TO SHUTDOWN THE EMULATOR------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am assuming the Emulator is already started.
Type "shutdown" at the Prompt.
If a "Traceback" error appears, that is normal.
The Emulator should now be shut down!
